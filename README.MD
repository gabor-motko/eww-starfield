# The physiognomy of window managers.

I'll admit, I had to look up the meaning of *physiognomy*. According to Wikipedia, it is "the practice of assessing  a person's character [...] from their outer appearance." According to others, it is the story of how Mark Kern became the laughing stock of the internet for a few days.

I made this as a mockery, but decided to develop it into something usable. The menu appears on the bottom layer, below all windows. The logo in the center is an image - set the `center-image-path` variable to change it, or set it to `""` to remove it.
