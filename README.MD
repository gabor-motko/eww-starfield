# The physiognomy of window managers.

I'll admit, I had to look up the meaning of *physiognomy*. According to Wikipedia, it is "the practice of assessing  a person's character [...] from their outer appearance." According to others, it is the story of how Mark Kern became the laughing stock of the internet for a few days.

I made this as a mockery, but decided to develop it into something usable.
